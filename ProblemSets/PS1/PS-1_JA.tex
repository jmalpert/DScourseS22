\section{Introduction}

I am interested in economics and data science for many reasons.  I enjoy the challenge of the material and rewards for accomplishing tasks.  My interests in economics are in the area of income inequality.  This subject has become a major focus for many great economists such as Thomas Pikkety. For the data science side, I am interested in learning tools that will directly relevant to future job prospects.  Most businesses today value these skills much more than any others.  I am looking into doing my research paper in this class on something from labor economics.  I will graduate in May and the Department of Labor is one of the positions I am targeting.  My hope is to learn more about what they do through my project. My goal for this class is to equip myself with useful tools for the job market.
