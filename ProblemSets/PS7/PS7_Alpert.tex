8. I have come up with the question for my research paper.  I have also located the data I need to use.  The next step will be reviewing current literature to see if it has been done before.  This will also help with the formation of an econometric model.  Right now, I am planning on using an AR2 model for the paper.  In addition, I will be using graphical analysis to help with the visualization process.
