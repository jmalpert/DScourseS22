The data I scraped is concerning the largest contractors for the Federal Government.  This data is interesting because it shows the vast amount of revenue generated through Federal contracts.  This data will not be useful in the future as a I have no research projects about federal contracts.  I did not use any online tutorials.  Below is a picture of the manipulated data.

The data provided a listing of the opening and closing prices for the stock index over many years.  This wasn't particularly interesting and was expected.  Below is a screenshot of the data.
